## Loomweave (code structure + SEI identity)

Loomweave pre-extracts this repo into a queryable map — entities, their
call/reference/import/relation edges, and subsystems — each carrying a Stable
Entity Identity (SEI). Ask its `mcp__loomweave__*` tools, not grep, for "what
calls X", "what subclasses X", "where is X defined", "find the thing that
does Y".

- Never hand-construct an entity id: take it from `entity_find` / `entity_at` /
  `entity_resolve`, and bind cross-tool records on the `sei`, not the `id`.
- If `project_status_get` reports stale, re-index before answering.
